## Notes

- `raw_ocr_text` is preserved to allow manual verification if needed.
- `key_specifications` may contain normalized key-value pairs where possible.
- Products with low OCR confidence should be marked as `partial`.
- Failed extractions should still produce a row with `extraction_status = failed`.
